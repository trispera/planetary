# planetary

`planetary` is a Kubernetes-based task executor for the Task Execution Service (TES) specification.

## Configuration

### Network Policies

Network policies are disabled for task pods by default.
In production deployments, it is recommeded you enable network policies for the task pods.

The default network policy allows communication to `kube-dns` on port 53 - both UDP and TCP, HTTP communication back to the orchestrator, and all other IPv4 traffic on port 443.
It is suggested that you review this network policy for your use case and determine if there are requirements where this policy is not strict enough.
To fully lock down the task pods, we suggest a custom egress rule that allows internet connectivity on port 443 for all IPv4 ranges except the private CIDR ranges of your pods and services.
An example looks like:

```yaml
networkPolicies:
  enabled: true
  egressRules:
    - to:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
          except:
            - 10.244.0.0/16
            - 10.0.0.0/16
      ports:
        - port: 443
          protocol: TCP
```

This allows communication to cloud specific services such as IDMS on Azure and any other private networks.
Restrict further as needed if other network calls should not be allowed.
